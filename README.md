This plugin will display strings of a loaded assembly in a nice and comfortable ListView, keep in mind this plugin still under development
there is motivation towards it, but however with my currently limited knowledge on C# I'm unable to finish it off without further studying
on the respective parts of the other plugins, or, unless someone helps me finish it.
