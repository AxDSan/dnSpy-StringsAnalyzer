This plugin will display strings of a loaded assembly in a nice and comfortable ListView, keep in mind this plugin still under development
there is motivation towards it, but however with my currently limited knowledge on C# I'm unable to finish it off without further studying
on the respective parts of the other plugins, or, unless someone helps me finish it.

### [√] = Done / [-] = Missing

A lot of things have changed, if you want to keep up with the changes or want to see where I'm stuck, what I'm doing, please go check out my Trello: https://trello.com/b/Q2tutu97/dnspy-stringsanalyzer

StringsAnalyzer now display found strings inside a ToolWindow, not the same layout as before, but that layout (the previous one) is the intended one to be used.

More coming soon... stay tuned...
