# Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Vision
dnSpyStringsAnalyzer delivers a streamlined interface for enumerating and managing string literals in .NET assemblies analyzed or debugged inside dnSpy. This helps reverse engineers, analysts, and developers quickly navigate to potentially significant portions of code.

## 2. Key User Stories
- As a developer/reverse engineer, I want to quickly see all strings used by the program so I can examine them for debugging or security checks.
- As a user, I want to jump directly from a string reference to its usage in IL for further context.
- As a user, I may want to export the string list or receive at-a-glance metadata (e.g., method name, offset) to streamline my workflow.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- Parse .NET assemblies for string references by processing IL instructions.
- Display these strings along with relevant metadata (e.g., IL offsets, tokens, containing methods) in a custom tool window.
- Provide quick navigation from a string to the associated IL or method definition in dnSpy.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Handle large assemblies without significantly affecting dnSpy's performance.
- Reliability: Gracefully handle edge cases (e.g., assemblies with no strings or heavily obfuscated code).
- Maintainability: Keep the code modular and consistent to support ongoing improvements or bug fixes.

## 5. Extension Impact
- The extension aims to enhance dnSpy's capabilities by offering specialized string analysis features.
- The focus remains on in-editor string data retrieval and user-driven analysis.
