# Overview
Although dnSpyStringsAnalyzer is a plugin for a desktop environment (WPF-based UI), it has "frontend" aspects handled by WPF elements within dnSpy. This document lists basic guidelines for consistent user interface design and user experience.

# UI & UX Principles

## Integration with dnSpy's Theme
• Use consistent color schemes and styles from dnSpy (or from the provided resource dictionaries).
• Respect user preferences for high-contrast modes or custom themes.

## Modular Components
• Keep user controls in their own XAML files and partial classes.
• Limit code-behind complexity; prefer a clear MVVM-style separation if possible.

## Clear & Minimal Layout
• Provide essential search/filter features without overwhelming the user.
• Ensure the "Strings Analyzer" tool window fits well within dnSpy's main layout.

## Accessibility & Keyboard Support
• Provide keyboard shortcuts, like arrow-based navigation and tab focus, if relevant.
• Maintain high-contrast and screen reader friendly labels for any new UI elements.
